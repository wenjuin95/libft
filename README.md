<h1><b>this project is to learning how the standard functions of C programming work and coding them from scratch and make our own library</b></h1>

**`isalpha`**: Checks if a character is an alphabetic character.

**`isdigit`**: Checks if a character is a digit.

**`isalnum`**: Checks if a character is alphanumeric (either an alphabetic character or a digit).

**`isascii`**: Checks if a character is within the ASCII character set.

**`isprint`**: Checks if a character is printable (including space and standard printable characters).

**`toupper`**: Converts a lowercase character to its corresponding uppercase character.

**`tolower`**: Converts an uppercase character to its corresponding lowercase character.

**`memset`**: Fills a block of memory with a specified byte value.

**`bzero`** (historical, replaced by **`memset`** in modern C): Fills a block of memory with zeros.

**`memcpy`**: Copies a block of memory from one location to another.

**`memmove`**: Moves a block of memory from one location to another, handling overlap correctly.

**`strlcpy`**: Safely copies a null-terminated string to a destination buffer with a specified size.

**`strlcat`**: Safely concatenates two null-terminated strings to a destination buffer with a specified size.

**`strchr`**: Searches for the first occurrence of a character in a null-terminated string.

**`strrchr`**: Searches for the last occurrence of a character in a null-terminated string.

**`strncmp`**: Compares two null-terminated strings up to a specified number of characters.

**`memchr`**: Searches for a specific byte within a block of memory.

**`memcmp`**: Compares two blocks of memory up to a specified number of bytes.

**`strnstr`**: Searches for the first occurrence of a substring within a string, respecting a specified maximum length.

**`strlen`**: Calculates the length of a null terminated string.

**`calloc`**: Allocates a block of memory for an array of elements and initializes them to zero.

**`strdup`**: Duplicates a null-terminated string, allocating memory for the copy.

**`atoi`**: Converts a string representation of an integer to an integer value.

 **`ft_striteri`**: Applies a function to each character of a string with its index.

**`ft_strmapi`**: Applies a function to each character of a string and creates a new string with the results.

**`ft_substr`**: Extracts a substring from a string.

**`ft_strjoin`**: Concatenates two strings.

**`ft_strtrim`**: Trims leading and trailing whitespace characters from a string.

**`ft_split`**: Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

**`ft_itoa`**: Converts an integer to a string.

**`ft_putchar_fd`**: Outputs a character to a specified file descriptor.

**`ft_putstr_fd`**: Outputs a string to a specified file descriptor.

**`ft_putendl_fd`**: Outputs a string followed by a newline to a specified file descriptor.

**`ft_putnbr_fd`**: Outputs an integer to a specified file descriptor.

**`ft_lstnew`**: Creates a new linked list node.

**`ft_lstadd_front`**: Adds a new node to the front of a linked list.

**`ft_lstsize`**: Calculates the number of elements in a linked list.

**`ft_lstlast`**: Returns the last node of a linked list.

**`ft_lstadd_back`**: Adds a new node to the end of a linked list.

**`ft_lstdelone`**: Deletes a node from a linked list, freeing its memory.

**`ft_lstclear`**: Deletes all nodes in a linked list, freeing their memory.

**`ft_lstiter`**: Applies a function to each node in a linked list.

**`ft_lstmap`**: Applies a function to each node in a linked list and creates a new linked list with the results.
